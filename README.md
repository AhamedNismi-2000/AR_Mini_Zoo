# 🦁 AR Zoo Cards – Interactive Augmented Reality Animal Experience

The **AR Zoo Cards** project brings wildlife to life through **Augmented Reality (AR)**.  
By scanning printed or digital animal cards, users can see **3D animated animals** appear in real space — moving, walking, or roaring — right on their devices.  
This project was developed as part of a **university AR development assignment**, combining creativity, education, and technology.

## 🌍 Overview

**AR Zoo Cards** is an educational and interactive application that uses AR to help users — especially children — learn about animals in an engaging way.  
Each card represents a different animal (A–Z), and when scanned using a smartphone or tablet camera, a 3D animated model of the animal appears in the real world using AR.

This project demonstrates how AR can be used for **gamified learning** and **interactive education**, merging technology and curiosity to make learning fun.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧩 **A–Z Animal Collection** — 26 animals from A to Z, each represented by a unique AR card.
- 🐘 **3D Animated Models** — Both **cartoon/low-poly** and **realistic** versions with at least one animation (e.g., walking, idle, roaring).
- 📱 **Augmented Reality Integration** — Uses **Unity** with **Vuforia** for marker-based AR tracking.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface** — Simple layout for scanning cards and interacting with animals.
- 🔊 **Sound Effects (optional)** — Animal sounds can be played when the model appears.
- 💡 **Educational Purpose** — Each animal card includes facts like name, habitat, and sound.
