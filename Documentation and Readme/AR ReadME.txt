 🦁 AR Zoo Card - Augmented Reality App

The AR Zoo Card is a fun and educational augmented reality (AR) application that brings animal flashcards to life. When you point your device's camera at an animal card (image target), it displays a 3D model of the animal along with realistic sounds  like a lion roaring or a bird chirping.


 📦 Setup Instructions

 1. 📁 Unzip the Image Targets
 Download the .rar file containing the **image targets**.
 Extract the contents to a folder on your computer or mobile device.
 These images are required to trigger the 3D animal models in the app.



2. 📱 Install the AR App
 Install the **AR Zoo Card APK** (if provided) on your Android device.
 You can also build the project from source using Unity and Vuforia SDK(if needed).



3. 📸 Grant Camera Permission
 On first launch, the app will ask for camera access.
 Grant permission, as it is necessary for detecting image targets.



 4. 🧩 Using the App
 Launch the AR Zoo Card app.
 Place one of the **printed image targets** in front of your camera.
 Watch the 3D animal model appear on the screen!
 Enjoy the realistic animal sounds for each card.
